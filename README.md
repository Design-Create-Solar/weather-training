# weather-training

Training repository for DCS: Software.
Participants are tasked to design an application that uses the OpenWeatherAPI.
Visual frameworks and components are left to the discretion of the developer.

#### Requirements

Functionality should support the following:

- The program clearly uses React (not vanilla Javascript).
- The program can be compiled and launched locally to a webpage (i.e. http://localhost:3000/)
- The user must be able to interact with the API somehow (input, button, toggle, etc.)
- The user must be able to receive output upon request in some shape or form.

It will not be tested:

- How informative the output is (but don't just print nothing!).
- How the interaction is created for the user to communicate with the API.

#### Environment

For this repository, we will be using **[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)** to automatically set build preconfigurations (Webpack & Babel) for React development.
Main benefits:

- Minimalistic build
- Simple deployment
- Client-side rendering & lack of SEO support will not impact performance.

To get started,

- Clone the repository by typing in `git clone https://github.com/sweeneyngo/weather-training.git`.
- Go into your repository via `cd weather-training`.
- Don't have the dependencies? `npm i`.
- Want to run your application in development? `npm run start`.

#### "Your instructions are confusing! I need more help!"
